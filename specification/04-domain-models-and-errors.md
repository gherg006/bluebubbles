# Task 04 — Domain models and errors

> This is a self-contained implementation task split from the complete BlueBubbles Version 1.0 specification. Source requirements below are reproduced verbatim, not summarised. Where a repeated project-wide rule conflicts with a task-local choice, the project-wide rule wins.

## Required predecessors

Task 02, Task 03.

## Completion boundary

Implement the whole task, all integrations named in this file, its tests, documentation, migration or configuration effects, and its stage exit checks. Do not implement later tasks merely because their contracts are visible for integration.

# BlueBubbles Software Engineering & Architecture Specification
## Version 1.0
### Author
Zak MacLeod

---

# Document Purpose

This document serves as the complete software engineering specification for the BlueBubbles messaging platform.

Unlike a traditional Software Requirements Specification (SRS), this document has been designed specifically to act as the master blueprint for both human software engineers and modern AI coding assistants.

The purpose of this document is to remove ambiguity from development by specifying every architectural decision before implementation begins.

This document should be considered the single source of truth for the project.

Whenever implementation decisions conflict with this document, this document takes precedence.

---

# Document Goals

BlueBubbles shall be developed as a professional, enterprise-grade desktop messaging platform designed exclusively for Local Area Networks (LANs).

The application must prioritise:

- Security
- Reliability
- Maintainability
- Scalability
- Readability
- Extensibility
- Performance
- Low Resource Usage

The software must be capable of operating entirely without an Internet connection.

No cloud services may ever be required.

All communication shall remain inside the organisation's own network.

---

# Intended Audience

This document is intended for:

• Software Engineers

• AI Coding Models

• Security Analysts

• OCR A-Level NEA Moderators

• System Administrators

• Future Developers

---

# Coding Philosophy

BlueBubbles shall not be developed as a prototype.

It shall instead follow professional software engineering practices used in industry.

Every feature shall be designed before implementation.

Every class shall have a single responsibility.

Every module shall solve exactly one problem.

Every dependency shall have a clearly defined purpose.

Every component shall be testable independently.

---

# Software Engineering Principles

The project shall follow the following principles.

## SOLID

### Single Responsibility Principle

Each class shall only have one reason to change.

Example:

UserRepository

ONLY interacts with users.

Never encrypts messages.

Never performs authentication.

Never communicates directly with the GUI.

---

MessageEncryptor

ONLY encrypts messages.

Never stores messages.

Never communicates with the database.

Never authenticates users.

---

ChatWindow

ONLY displays data.

Never communicates directly with PostgreSQL.

Never performs encryption.

Never performs authentication.

---

### Open / Closed Principle

Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

New features should normally be implemented through inheritance or composition rather than modifying stable code.

---

### Liskov Substitution Principle

Derived classes must always be usable in place of their parent classes.

---

### Interface Segregation Principle

Interfaces shall remain small and focused.

Avoid "God Interfaces".

---

### Dependency Inversion Principle

High-level modules shall never depend directly upon low-level implementations.

Dependencies shall instead depend upon abstractions.

---

# Object Oriented Programming Standards

The entire codebase shall be Object Oriented.

Procedural programming shall only be used where it improves readability.

Every significant object inside the system shall be represented as a class.

Examples include:

User

Message

Conversation

Attachment

Server

Session

Notification

FileTransfer

Group

Channel

Presence

EncryptionContext

AuthenticationSession

DatabaseConnection

SettingsManager

ThemeManager

KeyManager

AuditLogger

---

No global mutable state shall exist.

Configuration shall instead be loaded through dependency injection.

---

# Architectural Goals

The software shall be designed around loose coupling.

Modules should know as little as possible about one another.

The software shall instead communicate through:

Interfaces

DTOs

Events

Dependency Injection

Service Layers

Repository Layers

---

The architecture shall support future features without requiring significant rewrites.

Future features include:

Voice Calls

Video Calls

Screen Sharing

Remote Desktop

Message Reactions

---

# High-Level System Overview

The application consists of five major systems.

──────────────────────────────

Desktop Client

↓

API Layer

↓

Application Services

↓

Persistence Layer

↓

Storage

──────────────────────────────

The Desktop Client is responsible only for presentation.

The API Layer exposes endpoints.

Application Services contain business logic.

Repositories communicate with databases.

Storage manages PostgreSQL, Redis and encrypted files.

---

# Architectural Rules

The GUI may NEVER communicate directly with PostgreSQL.

The GUI may NEVER perform SQL queries.

The GUI may NEVER manipulate cryptographic keys.

The GUI may NEVER perform authentication.

The GUI must communicate exclusively with service classes.

---

Services shall never render GUI components.

Repositories shall never perform encryption.

Encryption classes shall never communicate directly with SQL.

Authentication classes shall never display GUI windows.

Every responsibility belongs to exactly one layer.

---

# Performance Objectives

The application shall remain responsive under normal office workloads.

Target Performance

10 simultaneous users

Average message latency:

<100ms on Gigabit LAN

Message delivery:

<300ms

Cold startup:

<5 seconds

Warm startup:

<2 seconds

Database query:

<50ms average

Message encryption:

<5ms

Conversation loading:

<250ms

Search:

<500ms

File transfer startup:

<200ms

Memory usage:

Idle Client

<300MB RAM

Typical Client

<600MB RAM

Server

<4GB RAM for 50 users

---

# Security Objectives

BlueBubbles is designed around the assumption that attackers may already have access to the internal network.

Therefore:

The network shall never be trusted.

Clients shall never be trusted.

Servers shall never be trusted.

Authentication shall always be required.

Messages shall always remain encrypted.

Private keys shall never leave client devices.

The server shall never possess plaintext messages.

Every action shall be logged.

Every login shall be verified.

Every request shall be authenticated.

Every permission shall be checked.

---

# AI Development Instructions

The implementation AI shall follow these rules without exception.

DO NOT generate placeholder implementations.

DO NOT generate TODO comments.

DO NOT create unfinished methods.

DO NOT ignore type hints.

DO NOT merge unrelated classes.

DO NOT create God Objects.

DO NOT duplicate logic.

DO NOT sacrifice architecture for shorter code.

DO NOT skip testing.

DO NOT use weak cryptography.

DO NOT invent APIs.

DO NOT create undocumented behaviour.

Every generated file shall compile.

Every generated module shall contain documentation.

Every generated class shall include complete docstrings.

Every public method shall include:

Purpose

Arguments

Return Value

Exceptions

Every module shall be independently testable.

This concludes Part 1.

Part 2 begins with the complete system architecture, network topology, message lifecycle, encryption lifecycle, deployment architecture, and the rationale behind every major engineering decision.

# Part 2 — Complete System Architecture

---

# Chapter 1 — System Overview

BlueBubbles follows a traditional client-server architecture specifically designed for deployment within a trusted physical environment while assuming the network itself cannot be trusted.

Although all devices operate on the same Local Area Network (LAN), every communication channel is encrypted and authenticated. No client communicates directly with another client. Every request flows through the central server.

This architecture provides:

- Centralised user management
- Simplified backup
- Easier auditing
- Message persistence
- Reduced client complexity
- Better scalability
- Easier administration
- Complete separation of concerns

Unlike peer-to-peer messaging systems, the server acts as the authoritative source for all metadata while remaining incapable of reading encrypted message content.

# Chapter 3 — Architectural Philosophy

Every subsystem has exactly one responsibility.

No subsystem is permitted to "reach around" another subsystem.

Example:

Correct

GUI

↓

API Client

↓

Application Service

↓

Repository

↓

Database

Incorrect

GUI

↓

SQL Query

The second approach tightly couples the user interface to the database and violates separation of concerns.

---

# End of Part 2

The next section (Part 3) will define the **complete folder structure**, development standards, package layout, dependency graph, naming conventions, and the exact directory tree for every Python module before any code is written. This will become the blueprint that the coding AI follows when creating the project structure.

# Part 3 — Project Structure, Package Layout and Development Standards

---

# Chapter 15 — Project Philosophy

The project shall be organised using a modular architecture based upon Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

Each module shall have exactly one responsibility.

Large files containing unrelated logic are strictly prohibited.

# Part 30 — Project-wide execution and quality rules (selected verbatim chapters)

# Chapter 3325 — Final Execution Contract Purpose

This section defines the binding implementation contract for any coding AI, developer or automated development system producing BlueBubbles.

It converts the complete specification into mandatory execution rules.

The implementation process shall:

* Follow the defined architecture.
* Preserve the defined security boundaries.
* Produce functional code rather than placeholders.
* Build the project in dependency order.
* Verify each subsystem before continuing.
* Keep server and client protocol models compatible.
* Prevent plaintext content from entering server-controlled storage.
* Preserve user work during failures.
* Produce tested installation and recovery procedures.
* Generate documentation matching the final implementation.
* Deliver one complete Version 1.0 project.

Where an implementation choice conflicts with this specification, the specification shall take priority unless the change is documented formally and all affected requirements are updated.

---

# Chapter 3326 — Coding-AI Role

The coding AI shall act as:

```text
Software architect

Backend developer

Desktop-client developer

Database designer

Security engineer

Test engineer

Deployment engineer

Technical-documentation writer
```

It shall not act as an unconstrained code generator that produces disconnected files without verification.

Every generated component shall fit the defined system.

---

# Chapter 3327 — Binding Instruction Priority

Implementation decisions shall follow this priority:

```text
1. Security and data-integrity requirements

2. Explicit functional requirements

3. Architectural boundaries

4. Protocol and database contracts

5. Reliability and recovery requirements

7. User-interface requirements

8. Performance guidance

9. Optional implementation preferences
```

A lower-priority convenience shall not override a higher-priority requirement.

---

# Chapter 3328 — No Silent Requirement Changes

The coding AI shall not silently:

* Remove features.

Prohibited pattern:

```python
class Service:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.settings = load_settings()
        self.database = connect_database()
        self.redis = connect_redis()
```

Required pattern:

```python
class Service:
    def __init__(
        self,
        repository: Repository,
        permission_service: PermissionService,
        clock: Clock,
    ) -> None:

Prohibited global state includes:

```text
Current user
Current session
Current transaction
Current conversation
Current request
Current access token
Current message plaintext
Current encryption key
```

Application-wide immutable configuration and safely managed singleton resources are permitted.

---

# Chapter 3340 — Async Implementation Rule

Network, database and filesystem I/O shall use asynchronous interfaces where supported.

Examples:

```text
PostgreSQL queries
Redis operations
HTTP requests
WebSocket operations
LDAP requests where adapter support allows
File streaming

Long-running operations shall support cooperative cancellation.

Mandatory cancellable operations:

* Attachment preparation.
* Attachment upload.
* Attachment download.
* Full synchronisation.
* Search-index rebuild.
* Cache cleanup.
* Diagnostic-package generation.
* Large export generation where client controlled.

Cancellation shall occur only at safe boundaries.

---

# Chapter 3343 — Database Authority Rule

PostgreSQL shall remain authoritative for:

```text
Users
Roles
Permissions
Sessions
Conversation membership
Messages
Recipient envelopes
Attachments
Audit
Outbox
Announcements
Configuration history
Security alerts
Administrative records
```

Redis shall never become the only source of permanent business state.

---

# Chapter 3344 — Local Database Authority Rule

The client local database shall be authoritative only for local state such as:

```text
Drafts
Offline queue
Local cache
Transfer state
Search index
Synchronisation checkpoints
Local preferences
```

It shall not override current server membership, permissions or key revocation state.

---

# Chapter 3345 — Unit of Work Requirement

Every multi-record server business transaction shall use one Unit of Work.

Examples:

* Send message.
* Edit message.

* Publish announcement.
* Update configuration.

The business record, audit event and outbox event shall commit atomically where required.

---

# Chapter 3346 — Explicit Commit Rule

Services shall commit explicitly.

A context manager shall not automatically commit every transaction solely because no exception was raised unless that behaviour is deliberately standardised and documented.

The preferred pattern is:

```python
async with unit_of_work_factory() as unit_of_work:
    ...
    await unit_of_work.commit()
```

---

# Chapter 3347 — Transaction Duration Rule

Database transactions shall remain short.

Do not hold transactions open during:

Application validation alone is insufficient.

---

# Chapter 3352 — Soft Deletion Rule

Shared records shall use soft deletion or tombstones where history and references must remain intact.

Examples:

* Messages.
* Conversations.
* Users.
* Announcements.
* Attachments awaiting retention cleanup.

Physical deletion shall follow explicit retention and recovery rules.

# Chapter 3369 — Authorisation Rule

Every protected server endpoint shall enforce:

```text
Authentication

↓

Session validity

↓

Enabled user state

↓

Named permission

↓

Resource-level policy
```

Client-side hidden buttons are not authorisation.

Policy
Conversation membership
Relevant permissions
Recipient public keys
```

Stale local assumptions shall never override server state.

---

# Chapter 3372 — Idempotency Rule

Every retryable write shall have a stable idempotency identifier.

At minimum:

* Message send uses stable message UUID.
* Upload chunks use upload ID and chunk index.
* Announcement acknowledgement uses stable user and announcement identity.
* Preference writes use action identity or expected version.
* Administrative background jobs use job UUID.

---

# Chapter 3373 — Duplicate Conflict Rule

A repeated request may be treated as success only when the stored operation is equivalent to the repeated request.

A duplicate identifier with different content shall return a conflict.

The system shall never replace an existing message silently because a client reused its UUID incorrectly.

---

# Chapter 3374 — Offline Work Preservation Rule

Drafts, pending messages and prepared attachments shall not be removed automatically because:

* The server is offline.
* Synchronisation fails.
* A message conflicts.
* An edit window expires.
* Membership changes.

Each user profile shall have separate:

* Local database.
* Local encryption keys.
* Drafts.
* Offline queue.
* Transfer state.
* Search index.
* Cached messages.
* Secure-store namespace.

Signing in as another user shall not expose or process the previous user’s data.

Infrastructure or adapter error

↓

Application error

↓

API or client error model

Fully tested
Production ready
Secure
Verified
All tests pass
```

unless the corresponding work was actually performed and evidence exists.

---

## Task-specific authoritative source: Part 17

# Part 17 — Error Handling, Diagnostics and Recovery

---

# Chapter 1001 — Error-Handling Subsystem Purpose

The error-handling subsystem defines how BlueBubbles detects, classifies, records, communicates and recovers from failures.

It shall ensure that:

* Users receive clear explanations.
* Technical details remain available to administrators.
* Sensitive information is never exposed.
* Recoverable failures trigger safe retries.
* Permanent failures are not retried indefinitely.
* Partial operations are rolled back.
* Errors can be traced across components.
* Degraded services remain usable where safe.
* Unexpected crashes preserve useful diagnostics.
* The application never fails silently.

Error handling shall be consistent across the client, server, workers, WebSockets, storage and external dependencies.

---

# Chapter 1002 — Error-Handling Principles

BlueBubbles shall follow these principles:

```text
Fail safely.

Prefer explicit failure over silent data loss.

Do not expose secrets.

Use stable error codes.

Preserve transactional consistency.

Retry only recoverable failures.

Apply bounded retry limits.

Provide correlation identifiers.

Separate user messages from technical details.

Record enough context for diagnosis.

Avoid duplicate error reporting.

Never claim success before durable completion.
```

---

# Chapter 1003 — Error Categories

Errors shall be grouped into broad categories.

```text
VALIDATION
AUTHENTICATION
AUTHORISATION
RESOURCE
CONFLICT
RATE_LIMIT
NETWORK
DEPENDENCY
DATABASE
REDIS
STORAGE
CRYPTOGRAPHY
PROTOCOL
FILE_TRANSFER
LOCAL_STORAGE
CONFIGURATION
WORKER
INTERNAL
```

Each category shall map to:

* A stable machine-readable code.
* A safe user-facing message.
* A severity.
* A retry classification.
* An HTTP or WebSocket result where applicable.
* A logging policy.

---

# Chapter 1004 — Base Exception Hierarchy

```python
class BlueBubblesError(Exception):
    """Base class for expected application errors."""

    def __init__(
        self,
        code: str,
        user_message: str,
        *,
        technical_message: str | None = None,
        retryable: bool = False,
        severity: "ErrorSeverity" = ErrorSeverity.ERROR,
        context: dict[str, object] | None = None,
    ) -> None:
        super().__init__(technical_message or user_message)
        self.code = code
        self.user_message = user_message
        self.technical_message = technical_message
        self.retryable = retryable
        self.severity = severity
        self.context = context or {}
```

Expected application errors shall inherit from this class.

Unexpected programming exceptions shall remain distinguishable from expected business errors.

---

# Chapter 1005 — Exception Subclasses

Recommended hierarchy:

```text
BlueBubblesError
│
├── ValidationError
├── AuthenticationError
│   ├── InvalidCredentialsError
│   ├── SessionExpiredError
│   ├── InvalidTokenError
│   └── AccountDisabledError
│
├── AuthorisationError
├── ResourceNotFoundError
├── ConflictError
├── RateLimitError
├── NetworkError
├── DependencyError
│   ├── DirectoryUnavailableError
│   ├── DatabaseUnavailableError
│   ├── RedisUnavailableError
│   └── StorageUnavailableError
│
├── RepositoryError
├── StorageError
├── CryptographyError
├── ProtocolError
├── FileTransferError
├── LocalStorageError
├── ConfigurationError
├── WorkerError
└── InternalApplicationError
```

Subclasses may add structured fields relevant to their domain.

---

# Chapter 1006 — Error Severity

```python
class ErrorSeverity(StrEnum):
    """Defines the operational severity of an error."""

    INFORMATIONAL = "informational"
    WARNING = "warning"
    ERROR = "error"
    CRITICAL = "critical"
```

Examples:

```text
Cancelled transfer:

INFORMATIONAL

Temporary network loss:

WARNING

Database transaction failure:

ERROR

Audit-chain failure:

CRITICAL
```

Severity does not automatically determine whether an error is retryable.

---

# Chapter 1007 — Retry Classification

```python
class RetryClassification(StrEnum):
    """Defines whether and how an operation may be retried."""

    NEVER = "never"
    IMMEDIATE_ONCE = "immediate_once"
    EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF = "exponential_backoff"
    RETRY_AFTER = "retry_after"
    USER_ACTION_REQUIRED = "user_action_required"
```

The retry classification shall be explicit.

The application shall not infer retry behaviour solely from a generic exception type.

---

# Chapter 1008 — Retryable Errors

Normally retryable:

```text
Connection timeout
Temporary DNS or LAN failure
Connection reset
HTTP 502
HTTP 503
HTTP 504
Redis temporarily unavailable
Temporary storage lock
Rate limit with retry-after value
WebSocket interruption
Temporary LDAP outage
```

A retry is only appropriate when the operation is safe and idempotent.

---

# Chapter 1009 — Non-Retryable Errors

Normally non-retryable:

```text
Invalid credentials
Permission denied
Account disabled
Unsupported protocol
Malformed request
Invalid signature
Invalid authentication tag
Conversation deleted
User removed from group
File type blocked
Message edit window expired
Conflicting idempotency identifier
```

These errors require user action, data correction or administrative intervention.

---

# Chapter 1010 — Retry Safety

Before retrying, the application shall determine whether the operation is idempotent.

Safe examples:

```text
GET request
Message send using fixed message UUID
Repeated identical chunk upload
Session refresh using protected rotation logic
Read-receipt update
Download chunk
```

Unsafe operations shall either:

* Use an idempotency key.
* Be redesigned transactionally.
* Require confirmation before retry.
* Not retry automatically.

---

# Chapter 1011 — Error Code Format

Stable error codes shall use uppercase words separated by underscores.

Examples:

```text
INVALID_CREDENTIALS
PERMISSION_DENIED
CONVERSATION_NOT_FOUND
MESSAGE_CONFLICT
DATABASE_UNAVAILABLE
UPLOAD_SESSION_EXPIRED
LOCAL_DATABASE_CORRUPT
UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL
```

Codes shall describe the condition rather than the internal exception class.

---

# Chapter 1012 — Error Code Stability

Once released, an error code shall not change meaning.

A new condition shall receive a new code.

Clients may map error codes to:

* User-facing messages.
* Recovery actions.
* Retry behaviour.
* Helpdesk guidance.
* Telemetry categories.

Internal Python class names may change without breaking clients.

---

# Chapter 1013 — API Error Envelope

Every REST API error shall use a common structure.

```python
class ApiErrorResponse(BaseModel):
    """Represents a safe structured REST API error."""

    success: bool = False
    error: "ApiErrorDetail"
    correlation_id: UUID
    timestamp: datetime
```

```python
class ApiErrorDetail(BaseModel):
    """Contains the client-safe details of one API failure."""

    code: str
    message: str
    retryable: bool
    retry_after_seconds: int | None = None
    field_errors: list["FieldError"] = []
```

---

# Chapter 1014 — Field Validation Errors

```python
class FieldError(BaseModel):
    """Describes one invalid request field."""

    field: str
    code: str
    message: str
```

Example:

```json
{
    "field": "title",
    "code": "VALUE_TOO_LONG",
    "message": "The group name must not exceed 100 characters."
}
```

Field errors shall not echo sensitive submitted values.

---

# Chapter 1015 — Example API Error

```json
{
    "success": false,
    "error": {
        "code": "NOT_CONVERSATION_MEMBER",
        "message": "You no longer have access to this conversation.",
        "retryable": false,
        "retry_after_seconds": null,
        "field_errors": []
    },
    "correlation_id": "a73d4d13-e978-4bd6-b443-aee18c26d171",
    "timestamp": "2026-07-16T17:00:00Z"
}
```

Internal stack traces shall not appear in the response.

---

# Chapter 1016 — HTTP Status Mapping

Recommended mappings:

| Error Category          | HTTP Status |
| ----------------------- | ----------: |
| Validation              |  400 or 422 |
| Invalid authentication  |         401 |
| Permission denied       |         403 |
| Missing resource        |         404 |
| Locked account          |         423 |
| Conflict                |         409 |
| Payload too large       |         413 |
| Rate limited            |         429 |
| Dependency unavailable  |         503 |
| Unexpected server error |         500 |

The same application code shall map consistently to the same status.

---

# Chapter 1017 — 401 and 403 Distinction

Use:

```text
401 Unauthorized
```

when authentication is missing, invalid or expired.

Use:

```text
403 Forbidden
```

when the user is authenticated but lacks permission.

This distinction shall remain consistent across all endpoints.

---

# Chapter 1018 — WebSocket Error Envelope

WebSocket failures shall use a structured event.

```json
{
    "event_id": "uuid",
    "event_type": "error",
    "protocol_version": 1,
    "timestamp": "2026-07-16T17:00:00Z",
    "correlation_id": "uuid",
    "data": {
        "code": "PERMISSION_DENIED",
        "message": "You cannot perform this action.",
        "retryable": false,
        "request_event_id": "uuid"
    }
}
```

The request event identifier links the error to the initiating client event.

---

# Chapter 1019 — WebSocket Close Codes

Standard close codes shall be used where possible.

Recommended use:

```text
1000

Normal closure

1001

Server shutdown or endpoint going away

1008

Policy violation or unauthorised action

1009

Message too large

1011

Unexpected server condition
```

Application-specific meaning shall be placed in the structured final event where possible.

---

# Chapter 1020 — Correlation Identifiers

Every important operation shall receive a correlation identifier.

A correlation ID shall be:

* A UUID.
* Generated at the first trusted boundary.
* Propagated through services.
* Included in structured logs.
* Included in safe error responses.
* Included in durable events where relevant.
* Included in background jobs derived from the operation.

Clients may submit an identifier, but the server shall validate or replace malformed values.

---

# Chapter 1021 — Correlation Context

```python
class CorrelationContext:
    """Stores trace identifiers for the current operation."""

    correlation_id: UUID
    request_id: UUID | None
    session_id: UUID | None
    user_id: UUID | None
```

Context variables may be used to propagate correlation data through asynchronous code.

---

# Chapter 1022 — Correlation Middleware

The middleware shall:

```text
Read X-Correlation-ID header if valid

↓

Generate UUID if missing or invalid

↓

Store identifier in request context

↓

Add identifier to response header

↓

Add identifier to logs

↓

Include identifier in error response
```

Response header:

```text
X-Correlation-ID
```

---

# Chapter 1023 — Error Context

Technical error context may include:

```text
Component name
Operation name
Resource identifier
User identifier
Session identifier
Retry attempt
Dependency state
Correlation identifier
```

It shall not include:

```text
Password
Raw token
Private key
Message plaintext
Attachment plaintext
LDAP bind secret
Database password
```

---

# Chapter 1024 — Exception Translation

Infrastructure exceptions shall be translated before reaching API handlers.

Example:

```text
asyncpg connection exception

↓

Repository catches infrastructure exception

↓

Raises DatabaseUnavailableError

↓

Global handler maps to:

503 DATABASE_UNAVAILABLE
```

Clients shall not depend upon database-library exception names.

---

# Chapter 1025 — Repository Error Translation

Repositories shall translate:

```text
Unique constraint violation
Foreign key violation
Connection failure
Statement timeout
Transaction failure
```

into domain-appropriate repository exceptions.

Business services may then translate those into application errors.

Example:

```text
Unique direct-conversation constraint violation

↓

Existing conversation lookup

↓

Return existing conversation
```

Not every database exception should become a generic 500 response.

---

# Chapter 1026 — Global Server Exception Handler

The global handler shall:

* Recognise expected application errors.
* Select the correct HTTP status.
* Return the common error envelope.
* Record appropriate logs.
* Increment error metrics.
* Avoid duplicate logging.
* Handle unexpected exceptions safely.

Unexpected exceptions shall receive:

```text
INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
```

---

# Chapter 1027 — Unexpected Server Errors

User-facing response:

```text
BlueBubbles could not complete the request because of an unexpected server error.

Try again. If the problem continues, provide the error reference to the helpdesk.
```

The response shall include a correlation ID.

The server log shall include the traceback after sanitisation.

---

# Chapter 1028 — Client Error Model

```python
class ClientError:
    """Represents an error ready for client handling and display."""

    code: str
    title: str
    message: str
    severity: ErrorSeverity
    retryable: bool
    suggested_action: str | None
    correlation_id: UUID | None
    technical_details_available: bool
```

ViewModels shall expose client errors rather than raw exceptions.

---

# Chapter 1029 — Error Presentation Levels

The client shall use different presentation styles.

```text
Inline validation message

Used beside a form field.

Toast notification

Used for brief non-critical failures.

Banner

Used for connection or degraded-service state.

Dialog

Used for actions requiring user acknowledgement.

Dedicated error page

Used for startup, storage or unrecoverable application failure.
```

The severity and required user action shall determine the presentation.

---

# Chapter 1030 — User-Facing Error Language

Messages shall:

* Use plain English.
* Explain what failed.
* Explain whether data was saved.
* Give one useful next action.
* Avoid blame.
* Avoid internal jargon.
* Include a technical code where helpful.

Poor message:

```text
AsyncOperationException: connection refused.
```

Preferred message:

```text
BlueBubbles cannot reach the server.

Your unsent message has been kept and will be retried when the connection returns.

Error code: NETWORK_UNAVAILABLE
```

---

# Chapter 1031 — Error Titles

Recommended titles:

```text
Unable to connect
Message not sent
Upload interrupted
Session expired
Access denied
Local cache problem
Server unavailable
File could not be verified
Application configuration error
```

Titles shall describe the effect rather than the internal cause.

---

# Chapter 1032 — Error Message Ownership

The server shall provide a safe default message.

The client may replace it with a more suitable localised message based on the stable error code.

The client shall not replace an error with wording that changes its meaning.

Example:

```text
Server code:

ACCOUNT_DISABLED

Client message:

This account has been disabled. Contact the helpdesk.
```

---

# Chapter 1033 — ErrorMessageCatalog

```python
class ErrorMessageCatalog:
    """Maps stable error codes to user-facing client content."""

    def get_message(
        self,
        code: str,
        context: ErrorDisplayContext,
    ) -> ClientError:
        ...
```

Unknown error codes shall use a safe generic fallback while preserving the code for diagnostics.

---

# Chapter 1034 — Error Localisation

Error codes shall remain language-independent.

Display strings may later be localised.

The server shall not require clients to parse English text.

Version 1.0 may support English only, but the structure shall not prevent future localisation.

---

# Chapter 1035 — Form Validation Behaviour

Client-side form validation shall:

* Display errors near the affected field.
* Preserve user input except secrets after failed submission.
* Focus the first invalid field.
* Prevent duplicate submission.
* Avoid network calls for clearly invalid input.

Server validation shall still remain authoritative.

---

# Chapter 1036 — Password Error Handling

Passwords shall be cleared after:

```text
Invalid login
Directory error
Unexpected authentication failure
Window closure
```

The client may keep the username.

The password shall never appear in the returned validation error.

---

# Chapter 1037 — Transaction Failure Behaviour

If a transactional operation fails:

```text
Roll back the transaction

↓

Do not publish success event

↓

Do not update client state as successful

↓

Return structured error

↓

Preserve retryable client input

↓

Log correlation identifier
```

No partial business state shall remain unless the workflow explicitly supports partial progress.

---

# Chapter 1038 — Message Failure Behaviour

If a message send fails before server acknowledgement:

* Keep the local message item.
* Mark it failed or pending.
* Preserve the message UUID.
* Preserve the draft source where possible.
* Classify the error.
* Retry only if safe.
* Allow manual retry.
* Never display it as stored.

---

# Chapter 1039 — Attachment Failure Behaviour

If an upload fails:

* Preserve completed encrypted chunks where resumable.
* Preserve upload-session information.
* Remove incomplete plaintext temporary data.
* Display the failed chunk or stage where useful.
* Retry only missing chunks.
* Avoid restarting the entire transfer unnecessarily.

If final checksum verification fails, the attachment shall not become complete.

---

# Chapter 1040 — Session Error Behaviour

When an access token expires:

```text
Pause protected request

↓

Attempt one refresh

↓

Retry original request once after successful refresh
```

If refresh fails:

```text
Stop protected operations

↓

Preserve drafts and queues

↓

Clear invalid session secrets

↓

Return to login
```

The client shall avoid multiple simultaneous refresh requests.

---

# Chapter 1041 — Refresh Coordination

```python
class TokenRefreshCoordinator:
    """Ensures that only one token refresh occurs at a time."""

    async def refresh_if_required(self) -> RefreshResult:
        ...

    async def wait_for_active_refresh(self) -> RefreshResult:
        ...
```

Other requests shall wait for the existing refresh result.

This prevents refresh-token reuse caused by concurrent rotation attempts.

---

# Chapter 1042 — Network Timeout Classes

Separate timeout types shall be recognised:

```text
Connection timeout
Read timeout
Write timeout
Pool timeout
WebSocket heartbeat timeout
```

Different timeouts may require different recovery behaviour.

A read timeout during an idempotent request may be retried.

A write timeout during a non-idempotent request requires idempotency verification.

---

# Chapter 1043 — Retry Policy

```python
class RetryPolicy:
    """Defines bounded retry behaviour for one operation category."""

    maximum_attempts: int
    initial_delay_seconds: float
    maximum_delay_seconds: float
    multiplier: float
    jitter_ratio: float
    retryable_codes: set[str]
```

Policies shall be defined by operation type.

---

# Chapter 1044 — Exponential Backoff

Recommended delays:

```text
Attempt 1:

2 seconds

Attempt 2:

4 seconds

Attempt 3:

8 seconds

Attempt 4:

16 seconds

Later attempts:

Maximum 30 seconds
```

Random jitter shall be applied.

This prevents many clients from retrying simultaneously after a server restart.

---

# Chapter 1045 — Retry Limits

Suggested automatic retry limits:

```text
Ordinary REST request:

3 attempts

Message send:

Until permanent failure or queue policy expiry

Chunk upload:

3 attempts per chunk before transfer pause

Chunk download:

3 attempts per chunk

WebSocket reconnect:

Continues with bounded interval while application is open

LDAP bind inside one login request:

No repeated credential bind beyond controlled policy
```

Retries shall not bypass rate limiting.

---

# Chapter 1046 — Retry-After Handling

For HTTP 429 or temporary maintenance responses, the server may return:

```text
Retry-After
```

The client shall respect the server value within configured safety bounds.

The user shall see a clear state such as:

```text
Waiting before retrying…
```

---

# Chapter 1047 — Circuit Breaker Purpose

A circuit breaker prevents repeated calls to a failing dependency.

Suitable dependencies:

```text
Active Directory
Redis
PostgreSQL health probes
Attachment storage
Internal event publisher
```

It shall not replace ordinary health checks.

---

# Chapter 1048 — Circuit Breaker States

```python
class CircuitState(StrEnum):
    """Defines the current state of a circuit breaker."""

    CLOSED = "closed"
    OPEN = "open"
    HALF_OPEN = "half_open"
```

Meaning:

```text
CLOSED

Requests operate normally.

OPEN

Requests fail quickly without calling the dependency.

HALF_OPEN

A limited test request checks whether the dependency recovered.
```

---

# Chapter 1049 — CircuitBreaker

```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    """Prevents repeated calls to a failing dependency."""

    async def execute(
        self,
        operation: Callable[..., Awaitable[ResultType]],
    ) -> ResultType:
        ...

    def record_success(self) -> None:
        ...

    def record_failure(self) -> None:
        ...
```

Configuration:

```text
Failure threshold
Open duration
Half-open test count
Failure categories
```

---

# Chapter 1050 — Circuit Breaker Rules

A circuit shall open only for dependency or infrastructure failures.

It shall not open because of:

```text
Invalid password
Permission denied
Missing resource
Request validation error
```

These are user or business outcomes, not dependency failures.

---

# Chapter 1051 — Service Degradation

BlueBubbles shall continue operating with reduced functionality where safe.

Examples:

```text
Redis unavailable:

Messages may continue through PostgreSQL.
Presence and typing indicators may be unavailable.

Attachment storage unavailable:

Text messaging may continue.
File upload and download are disabled.

Active Directory unavailable:

Existing sessions may continue according to policy.
New directory logins fail.

Search index unavailable:

Messaging continues.
Local search is disabled.
```

---

# Chapter 1052 — Degraded Capability Model

```python
class CapabilityState(BaseModel):
    """Describes whether one application capability is available."""

    capability: str
    available: bool
    degraded: bool
    reason_code: str | None
    message: str | None
    checked_at: datetime
```

The client may use these states to disable affected controls.

---

# Chapter 1053 — Degraded Service Banner

Example:

```text
File transfers are temporarily unavailable.

Text messaging is still working. BlueBubbles will restore file transfers automatically when server storage becomes available.
```

The banner shall not imply that the entire system is offline when only one capability failed.

---

# Chapter 1054 — Dependency Recovery

When a failed dependency recovers:

```text
Circuit enters half-open state

↓

Health check succeeds

↓

Circuit closes

↓

Capability becomes available

↓

Alert is updated

↓

Clients receive capability-restored event where useful
```

Recovery shall be logged once rather than for every successful request.

---

# Chapter 1055 — Error Deduplication

Repeated identical errors shall be grouped.

Deduplication key may include:

```text
Error code
Component
Resource type
Dependency
Time window
```

This reduces:

* Log flooding.
* Repeated alerts.
* Duplicate dialogs.
* Excessive metrics.

---

# Chapter 1056 — Client Notification Deduplication

The client shall avoid showing the same connection error repeatedly.

Example:

```text
First failure:

Show banner.

Continued failures:

Update banner state silently.

Recovery:

Show brief restored notification.
```

One failing queued message may still have its own visible state.

---

# Chapter 1057 — Error Metrics

Metrics shall include:

```text
Errors by code
Errors by component
Retry attempts
Retry successes
Retry exhaustion
Circuit-breaker openings
Dependency failures
Unexpected exceptions
Client crash count
Worker failure count
```

Metric labels shall avoid high-cardinality values such as raw message IDs.

---

# Chapter 1058 — Logging Levels

Recommended mapping:

```text
DEBUG

Detailed development flow without secrets

INFO

Normal lifecycle and successful significant operations

WARNING

Recoverable or degraded condition

ERROR

Operation failed or data could not be processed

CRITICAL

System integrity or essential service failure
```

Expected user validation errors normally do not require ERROR-level logging.

---

# Chapter 1059 — Single-Point Error Logging

Each error shall be logged at the layer with enough context to handle it properly.

The same exception shall not be logged repeatedly by:

```text
Repository
Service
Router
Global handler
```

Recommended approach:

* Lower layers add structured context or translate exceptions.
* The boundary handler performs final logging.
* Critical security events may also create audit or alert records.

---

# Chapter 1060 — Traceback Policy

Tracebacks shall be recorded for:

```text
Unexpected exceptions
Programming defects
Unhandled worker failures
Unexpected dependency-library failures
```

Tracebacks are usually unnecessary for:

```text
Invalid credentials
Permission denied
Expected validation failure
Known message conflict
User-cancelled transfer
```

This keeps logs useful.

---

# Chapter 1061 — Sensitive Traceback Sanitisation

Tracebacks and local variables may contain secrets.

The error logger shall:

* Avoid dumping complete request bodies.
* Avoid serialising stack-frame locals automatically.
* Redact secret-aware values.
* Remove authorisation headers.
* Remove password fields.
* Avoid logging decrypted payloads.
* Limit exception argument output where necessary.

---

# Chapter 1062 — Diagnostic Logging Context

Recommended fields:

```text
timestamp
level
error_code
component
operation
correlation_id
request_id
user_id
session_id
retry_attempt
dependency
duration_ms
```

Resource identifiers may be included when necessary and permitted.

---

# Chapter 1063 — Client Log Files

Client logs may include:

```text
client.log
network.log
storage.log
transfer.log
security.log
```

Logs shall be stored under the user-specific application directory.

They shall rotate and remain bounded.

---

# Chapter 1064 — Server Log Files

Server logs may include:

```text
application.log
authentication.log
security.log
database.log
websocket.log
file_transfer.log
worker.log
performance.log
```

The log configuration defined in Part 14 remains authoritative.

---

# Chapter 1065 — Diagnostic Package Purpose

A diagnostic package allows a user or helpdesk technician to collect relevant troubleshooting information without manually locating files.

The package shall exclude sensitive message and key material.

---

# Chapter 1066 — Diagnostic Package Contents

Possible contents:

```text
Sanitised client logs
Application version
Protocol version
Operating-system version
Client configuration summary
Server hostname
Connection test results
Local storage health
Cache-size summary
Recent error codes
Transfer failure metadata
Certificate fingerprint
```

It shall not contain:

```text
Passwords
Tokens
Private keys
Message plaintext
Attachment plaintext
Draft text
Full local database
Search terms
```

---

# Chapter 1067 — DiagnosticPackageService

```python
class DiagnosticPackageService:
    """Creates a sanitised local troubleshooting archive."""

    async def create_package(
        self,
        options: DiagnosticPackageOptions,
    ) -> Path:
        ...

    async def validate_package(
        self,
        path: Path,
    ) -> DiagnosticPackageValidation:
        ...
```

The package shall be created only after explicit user action.

---

# Chapter 1068 — Diagnostic Package Format

Recommended format:

```text
ZIP archive
```

Example structure:

```text
bluebubbles-diagnostics/
├── summary.json
├── connection-tests.json
├── errors.json
├── logs/
│   ├── client.log
│   └── network.log
└── storage-health.json
```

The filename shall include a timestamp but not the user’s password or token.

---

# Chapter 1069 — Diagnostic Package Review

Before saving, the client may show:

```text
This package contains technical logs and device information.

It does not include message contents, passwords, private keys or attachment contents.
```

The user shall choose where to save it.

The application shall not upload it automatically.

---

# Chapter 1070 — Server Diagnostic Report

Administrators may run a server diagnostic report.

Checks may include:

```text
Configuration validity
Database connectivity
Redis connectivity
Directory connectivity
Storage access
Audit-chain health
Worker state
TLS certificate expiry
Backup status
```

The report shall redact credentials and secrets.

---

# Chapter 1071 — Crash Handling Purpose

An unexpected client or server crash shall:

* Preserve diagnostic information.
* Avoid exposing secrets.
* Avoid corrupting persistent data.
* Permit restart recovery.
* Inform the user or administrator clearly.
* Never claim that data was saved unless confirmed.

---

# Chapter 1072 — Client Crash Handler

```python
class ClientCrashHandler:
    """Captures unexpected client exceptions at the application boundary."""

    def install(self) -> None:
        ...

    def handle_exception(
        self,
        exception_type: type[BaseException],
        exception: BaseException,
        traceback_object: TracebackType,
    ) -> None:
        ...
```

It shall integrate with Python and Qt exception boundaries where practical.

---

# Chapter 1073 — Client Crash Behaviour

On an unrecoverable client exception:

```text
Stop dangerous ongoing writes

↓

Attempt to preserve drafts and transfer state

↓

Write sanitised crash record

↓

Close local database safely where possible

↓

Show crash dialog

↓

Offer restart
```

A crash handler shall not continue normal operation after unknown state corruption.

---

# Chapter 1074 — Client Crash Dialog

Example:

```text
BlueBubbles encountered an unexpected problem and must close.

Your saved drafts and transfer progress have been preserved where possible.

Error reference:
4d8c9504-ec52-46c5-bf56-8a5335ea6ef1
```

Actions:

```text
Restart BlueBubbles
Create diagnostic package
Close
```

---

# Chapter 1075 — Server Crash Behaviour

Unexpected server process termination shall rely on:

* PostgreSQL transaction durability.
* Idempotent client retries.
* Transactional outbox recovery.
* Resumable upload state.
* systemd restart policy.
* Structured crash logs.

The server shall not attempt to keep running after a fatal process-level failure.

---

# Chapter 1076 — Crash Reporting Without External Services

BlueBubbles is LAN-only.

Therefore, crash reports shall be:

```text
Stored locally
Available through diagnostic exports
Visible to administrators
Not uploaded to an external analytics provider
```

No external crash-reporting service shall be required.

---

# Chapter 1077 — Crash Record Model

```python
class CrashRecord:
    """Stores sanitised information about an unexpected process failure."""

    crash_id: UUID
    application_component: str
    application_version: str
    timestamp: datetime
    exception_type: str
    sanitised_message: str
    traceback_reference: str | None
    correlation_id: UUID | None
    recovered_state: dict[str, bool]
```

Crash records shall not include full memory dumps.

---

# Chapter 1078 — Recovery Modes

The client may support:

```text
Normal startup
Safe startup
Cache rebuild
Configuration reset
Offline diagnostic mode
```

The server may support:

```text
Normal startup
Configuration validation
Migration-only mode
Diagnostic mode
Audit verification mode
```

---

# Chapter 1079 — Client Safe Startup

Safe startup shall:

* Disable optional plugins or experimental features.
* Avoid opening the previous active conversation automatically.
* Delay transfer resumption.
* Use default appearance settings.
* Open local storage read-only initially where practical.
* Allow diagnostics and cache rebuild.

Version 1.0 may implement a simplified safe mode.

---

# Chapter 1080 — Cache Rebuild Recovery

If replaceable cache data is corrupt:

```text
Preserve drafts and offline actions

↓

Export diagnostic record

↓

Delete replaceable message and profile cache

↓

Retain protected credentials where safe

↓

Reconnect to server

↓

Re-download authorised data

↓

Rebuild search index
```

The user shall be told which local items could not be recovered.

---

# Chapter 1081 — Draft Recovery

After abnormal shutdown:

* Load saved drafts.
* Detect incomplete autosave transactions.
* Choose the newest valid draft version.
* Keep drafts linked to existing conversations.
* Mark drafts unavailable if the user lost conversation access.
* Never submit recovered drafts automatically.

---

# Chapter 1082 — Offline Queue Recovery

After restart:

```text
Load pending actions

↓

Verify local payload integrity

↓

Verify session state

↓

Refresh conversation membership

↓

Resume safe processing

↓

Leave permanent failures visible
```

A corrupted queue item shall not prevent other valid items from processing.

---

# Chapter 1083 — Transfer Recovery

Uploads and downloads shall resume from confirmed chunk state.

If recovery data conflicts with server state:

```text
Server-confirmed completed chunks win.

Local unconfirmed upload chunks may be retried.

Completed attachment state wins over local pending state.

Checksum mismatch stops recovery.
```

---

# Chapter 1084 — Database Recovery

For PostgreSQL failure:

* Roll back incomplete transactions.
* Reconnect with bounded backoff.
* Verify migration state after extended outage if necessary.
* Reprocess unpublished outbox events.
* Reconcile worker state.
* Mark readiness healthy only after checks pass.

---

# Chapter 1085 — Redis Recovery

After Redis reconnects:

```text
Recreate connection pool

↓

Restore namespace access

↓

Rebuild presence from active WebSockets

↓

Resume Pub/Sub subscriptions

↓

Resume transient rate limiting

↓

Clear degraded status
```

Expired typing state does not need recovery.

---

# Chapter 1086 — Storage Recovery

After attachment storage returns:

* Verify root access.
* Verify free capacity.
* Reconcile temporary uploads.
* Check completed attachment references.
* Resume valid transfers.
* Mark missing completed files as integrity failures.
* Clear degraded capability only after verification.

---

# Chapter 1087 — Active Directory Recovery

After directory recovery:

```text
Close directory circuit breaker

↓

Permit new login attempts

↓

Resume scheduled synchronisation

↓

Revalidate affected account states

↓

Invalidate sessions for newly disabled users

↓

Clear directory outage alert
```

Existing sessions shall follow configured policy.

---

# Chapter 1088 — Worker Failure Handling

A worker failure shall:

* Mark the worker failed.
* Record the error.
* Increment failure count.
* Retry according to worker policy.
* Avoid overlapping duplicate runs.
* Create an alert after repeated failure.
* Remain visible in administration.

Critical workers may affect readiness.

---

# Chapter 1089 — Worker Retry Policy

Recommended:

```text
First failure:

Retry after 30 seconds

Second failure:

Retry after 2 minutes

Third failure:

Retry after 10 minutes

Repeated failure:

Remain failed and alert administrator
```

The exact policy shall be configurable per worker.

---

# Chapter 1090 — Poison Work Items

A poison work item repeatedly fails while other work is valid.

Examples:

```text
One invalid outbox event
One corrupt export job
One malformed cleanup record
```

The worker shall:

* Limit retries for that item.
* Mark it failed.
* Continue processing other items where safe.
* Create an alert.
* Preserve diagnostic metadata.

---

# Chapter 1091 — Outbox Publication Failure

If an outbox event cannot be published:

* Leave it unpublished.
* Increment attempt count.
* Set next retry time.
* Preserve the committed business record.
* Avoid creating duplicate outbox rows.
* Alert after threshold.
* Use event ID for recipient deduplication.

---

# Chapter 1092 — Partial Event Delivery

If an event reaches some recipient sessions but not others:

* The message remains stored.
* The outbox event may be considered published to the event system.
* Disconnected clients recover through synchronisation.
* Connected delivery failures are logged.
* The server does not roll back the stored message.

Real-time notification is not the permanent source of truth.

---

# Chapter 1093 — Error Recovery State Machine

Operations with complex recovery shall use explicit states.

Example transfer state machine:

```text
QUEUED

↓

RUNNING

↓

WAITING_RETRY

↓

RUNNING

↓

COMPLETE
```

Possible terminal states:

```text
FAILED
CANCELLED
EXPIRED
```

State transitions shall be validated.

---

# Chapter 1094 — State Transition Validation

Incorrect transitions shall be rejected.

Examples:

```text
COMPLETE → RUNNING

Rejected

CANCELLED → COMPLETE

Rejected

WAITING_RETRY → RUNNING

Allowed
```

A shared state-machine helper may be used.

---

# Chapter 1095 — Error Recovery Audit Events

Security or administrative recovery actions shall be audited.

Examples:

```text
Session invalidated after token reuse
Audit verification failed
Storage restored
Administrator retried worker
Configuration restored
Data export failed
Cache recovery initiated by user
```

Ordinary client network retries do not require permanent audit events.

---

# Chapter 1096 — Recovery User Confirmation

User confirmation is required when recovery may:

* Remove local cache.
* Discard a draft.
* Cancel a transfer.
* Replace an existing downloaded file.
* Reset configuration.
* Log the user out.
* Delete local keys.

Automatic recovery shall be used only when it cannot cause meaningful data loss.

---

# Chapter 1097 — Error Help Codes

Selected errors may include a help code.

Example:

```text
NETWORK_UNAVAILABLE
Help code: NET-001
```

Helpdesk documentation may map the code to:

* Meaning.
* Likely cause.
* User checks.
* Administrator checks.
* Relevant logs.

Stable machine error codes remain authoritative.

---

# Chapter 1098 — Self-Diagnostic Error Mapping

Examples:

```text
NETWORK_UNAVAILABLE

Check server reachability and LAN connection.

TLS_CERTIFICATE_INVALID

Check certificate trust and hostname.

LOCAL_DATABASE_CORRUPT

Offer local cache rebuild.

DIRECTORY_UNAVAILABLE

Check Active Directory connectivity.

SERVER_STORAGE_FULL

Check attachment storage capacity.
```

The diagnostic tool shall not reveal protected server values.

---

# Chapter 1099 — Error Documentation

Every public error code shall document:

```text
Code
Meaning
Likely cause
Retry classification
HTTP status
User-facing message
Suggested user action
Suggested administrator action
Relevant component
```

Documentation shall be generated or validated against the code catalogue where practical.

---

# Chapter 1100 — ErrorCode Enum

```python
class ErrorCode(StrEnum):
    """Defines stable machine-readable application errors."""

    INVALID_REQUEST = "INVALID_REQUEST"
    INVALID_CREDENTIALS = "INVALID_CREDENTIALS"
    SESSION_EXPIRED = "SESSION_EXPIRED"
    PERMISSION_DENIED = "PERMISSION_DENIED"
    RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND = "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND"
    RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED = "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED"
    NETWORK_UNAVAILABLE = "NETWORK_UNAVAILABLE"
    DATABASE_UNAVAILABLE = "DATABASE_UNAVAILABLE"
    REDIS_UNAVAILABLE = "REDIS_UNAVAILABLE"
    STORAGE_UNAVAILABLE = "STORAGE_UNAVAILABLE"
    CRYPTOGRAPHIC_VERIFICATION_FAILED = (
        "CRYPTOGRAPHIC_VERIFICATION_FAILED"
    )
    UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL = "UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL"
    INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR = "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR"
```

Domain-specific modules may define additional codes in one central catalogue.

---

# Chapter 1101 — Error Catalogue Validation

Automated tests shall verify:

* Every public exception has an error code.
* Every error code has a display message.
* Every error code has retry classification.
* Every error code maps to one HTTP status where relevant.
* No duplicate code has conflicting meaning.
* Documentation includes every public code.

---

# Chapter 1102 — Error Privacy

Error messages shall not reveal:

```text
Whether an unrelated username exists
Database table names
Filesystem paths
Internal IP topology
LDAP distinguished names
Private-key fingerprints unnecessarily
Raw SQL
Stack traces
Server secrets
```

Authorised administrators may receive additional diagnostic context through protected tools.

---

# Chapter 1103 — Authentication Enumeration Protection

For login failures, use one general message:

```text
The username or password is incorrect.
```

Internal logs may distinguish:

```text
Unknown user
Incorrect password
Disabled directory account
Directory lookup failure
```

Access to those details shall be restricted.

---

# Chapter 1104 — Resource Enumeration Protection

When appropriate, unauthorised access to a resource may return:

```text
404 Not Found
```

instead of confirming that the resource exists.

This is suitable when revealing existence would create a privacy risk.

The decision shall be consistent per endpoint.

---

# Chapter 1105 — Error Rate Limiting

Repeated invalid requests may themselves be rate-limited.

Examples:

```text
Invalid login attempts
Invalid WebSocket events
Repeated unauthorised attachment requests
Malformed protocol frames
```

The response shall remain safe and shall not amplify an attack with expensive processing.

---

# Chapter 1106 — Client Startup Errors

Startup failures may include:

```text
Invalid installation configuration
Secure store unavailable
Local database key unavailable
Local database corrupt
Migration failure
Unsupported operating system
Missing required dependency
```

The client shall show a dedicated recovery page rather than a blank window.

---

# Chapter 1107 — Server Startup Errors

Startup failures may include:

```text
Invalid production configuration
Database unavailable
Migration mismatch
Storage inaccessible
Token secret invalid
Authentication provider misconfigured
Audit writer unavailable
TLS file invalid
```

The process shall exit non-zero after cleanup.

---

# Chapter 1108 — Startup Error Report

The console or service log shall show:

```text
Component
Error code
Safe description
Configuration path where applicable
Corrective action
Correlation or startup identifier
```

Secrets shall remain redacted.

---

# Chapter 1109 — Migration Failure Recovery

If a server migration fails:

* Stop startup.
* Roll back the migration transaction where supported.
* Preserve the database.
* Log the migration revision.
* Require administrator intervention.
* Do not automatically delete or recreate production tables.

If a local client-cache migration fails, replaceable cache may be rebuilt after drafts and queues are preserved.

---

# Chapter 1110 — Configuration Recovery

The client may offer:

```text
Restore previous configuration
Reset non-sensitive settings
Choose new server address
Open diagnostic mode
```

The server shall require configuration changes through files, environment values or authorised administration.

It shall not guess missing production secrets.

---

# Chapter 1111 — Logging Failure

If file logging fails:

* Attempt console or system journal logging.
* Mark health degraded.
* Avoid terminating messaging immediately if safe.
* Create an administrator alert.
* Never write sensitive data to an insecure fallback file.

Audit logging failure is more serious and may require rejecting high-impact operations.

---

# Chapter 1112 — Audit Write Failure

For operations requiring audit records, the preferred policy is:

```text
Business change and audit insert occur in one transaction.
```

If the audit insert fails:

```text
Roll back the business change.
```

This applies particularly to:

```text
Account disabling
Role changes
Group administration
Message deletion
Configuration changes
Data exports
```

Low-risk transient actions may use a separate policy if documented.

---

# Chapter 1113 — Security Verification Failure

If a signature or authentication tag fails:

* Reject the content.
* Do not display it as trusted.
* Do not retry decryption with guessed parameters.
* Log a security event.
* Avoid exposing key material.
* Allow retrieval of a corrected server record if one exists.
* Alert administrators after repeated failures.

---

# Chapter 1114 — Cryptographic Failure Messages

User-facing message:

```text
This message could not be verified and has not been displayed.

The message may be damaged or was created with an unsupported key.
```

The interface shall not display partially decrypted data.

---

# Chapter 1115 — Recovery Data Integrity

All recovery records shall include integrity protection where necessary.

Examples:

```text
Offline queue payload
Transfer manifest
Draft record
Cached decrypted payload
Diagnostic package manifest
```

If integrity verification fails, the record shall be quarantined rather than trusted.

---

# Chapter 1116 — Quarantine Storage

Corrupt local recovery items may be moved to:

```text
BlueBubbles/
└── recovery/
    └── quarantine/
```

Quarantined items shall:

* Remain encrypted.
* Use server-generated or client-generated identifiers.
* Be excluded from normal processing.
* Be removable through settings.
* Be described in diagnostics without exposing content.

---

# Chapter 1117 — Time Synchronisation Errors

Large clock differences may affect:

* Token validity.
* Certificate validity.
* Message timestamps.
* Retry scheduling.
* Audit display.

The server shall remain authoritative for security-sensitive time.

If client time differs significantly, display:

```text
Your computer’s clock appears to be incorrect.

Correct the date and time before signing in.
```

---

# Chapter 1118 — Version Compatibility Errors

When protocol versions do not overlap:

```text
Return UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL

Provide server version

Provide minimum client version

Do not attempt undefined fallback
```

The client shall direct the user to the approved internal update source.

---

# Chapter 1119 — Resource Exhaustion

The application shall detect:

```text
Low memory
Disk full
Database pool exhaustion
Too many WebSocket connections
Too many queued transfers
Too many worker tasks
```

It shall reject new work safely before complete failure where possible.

---

# Chapter 1120 — Queue Capacity Limits

Queues shall have configured maximum sizes.

Examples:

```text
Offline actions per client
Outbox events awaiting publication
Pending export jobs
Concurrent transfer queue
Administrative alert queue
```

When full:

* Reject or pause new work.
* Preserve existing work.
* Display a clear error.
* Alert administrators where appropriate.

---

# Chapter 1121 — Graceful Overload Behaviour

During overload, priority should be:

```text
Authentication and session validation

Text message persistence

Critical security and audit operations

Message retrieval

File transfers

Administrative statistics
```

Non-essential dashboard refreshes may be slowed or disabled first.

---

# Chapter 1122 — Error Handling Unit Tests

Tests shall include:

```text
Construct base application error
Map exception to error code
Map error code to HTTP status
Return API error envelope
Return WebSocket error event
Generate correlation identifier
Propagate correlation identifier
Redact secret context

```text
Error response contains no stack trace
Error response contains no SQL
Error response contains no filesystem path
Password absent from authentication error
Token absent from logs
Private key absent from crash record
Plaintext message absent from diagnostic package
Unknown resource does not leak existence where restricted
Invalid signature does not display plaintext
Request body is not dumped into logs
```

---

# Chapter 1127 — Crash Tests

Tests shall include:

```text
Unhandled client exception creates crash record
Crash dialog displays reference
Draft save attempted during crash
Transfer state preserved
Server fatal exception exits non-zero
systemd restarts server

Full memory-dump analysis
External incident-management integration
Automatic database failover
Distributed circuit-breaker coordination
```

---

# Chapter 1131 — Error Handling and Recovery Summary

BlueBubbles shall use a consistent error-handling architecture across all components.

Expected failures shall use typed application exceptions and stable error codes.

Unexpected failures shall be captured at application boundaries and returned as safe generic errors.

Every important operation shall have a correlation identifier.

The client shall receive:

* A clear title.
* A plain-language explanation.
* A retry indication.
* A suggested action.
* A technical reference where useful.

The server shall retain:

* Structured technical context.
* Sanitised traceback information.
* Dependency status.
* Retry attempts.
* Correlation identifiers.

Retries shall occur only when:

* The failure is temporary.
* The action is idempotent or protected by an idempotency key.
* The retry policy allows it.
* The maximum attempt count has not been exceeded.

Circuit breakers shall prevent repeated calls to failing dependencies.

BlueBubbles shall remain partially operational when non-essential components fail, provided security and data integrity are preserved.

Client crashes shall preserve drafts and transfer state where possible.

Server crashes shall rely on database transactions, outbox recovery, resumable transfers and service-manager restarts.

Diagnostic packages shall remain local and shall exclude passwords, tokens, keys, messages, drafts and attachment content.

The application shall never fail silently, claim false success or discard recoverable user work without explanation.

---

## Task-specific authoritative source: Part 21

# Part 21 — Source-Code Structure and Per-File Implementation Contract

---

# Chapter 1585 — Source-Code Structure Purpose

This section defines the final BlueBubbles repository layout and the responsibilities of each major source file.

The purpose is to ensure that the coding AI:

* Places code in predictable locations.
* Avoids duplicate classes.
* Keeps client and server code separate.
* Keeps shared contracts independent.
* Uses clear dependency directions.
* Avoids circular imports.
* Separates business logic from infrastructure.
* Creates testable modules.
* Does not place unrelated logic inside large files.
* Implements every required subsystem consistently.

The generated code shall follow this structure unless a small, clearly justified change is required.

---

# Chapter 1586 — Repository Root Layout

The complete repository shall use the following high-level structure:

server importing client
client importing server implementation
```

The client and server may share DTO definitions and protocol constants through `shared`.

---

# Chapter 1590 — Shared Package Purpose

The `shared` package shall contain code that is genuinely common to both client and server.

It may contain:

* Protocol enums.
* API DTOs.
* WebSocket event DTOs.
* Stable error codes.
* Shared validation constants.
* Version information.
* Canonical serialisation.
* Cryptographic envelope structures.

---

# Chapter 1823 — Import Boundary Rules

The following import rules shall be enforced:

```text
Views may import ViewModels and UI models.

ViewModels may import client services and client models.

Client services may import networking, security and repositories.

Server routers may import services and shared DTOs.

Server services may import domain models and repository interfaces.

Repositories may import ORM models and domain mappings.

Domain modules shall not import FastAPI, PySide6 or SQLAlchemy sessions.
```

---

# Chapter 1824 — Circular Import Prevention

Strategies:

* Use repository interfaces.
* Use service interfaces.
* Place shared DTOs in `shared`.
* Use event publication for secondary effects.
* Use local imports only as a last justified measure.
* Avoid importing package `__init__.py` files containing broad re-exports.

Circular imports shall be treated as an architecture defect rather than patched repeatedly.

---

# Chapter 1825 — **init**.py Rules

Package `__init__.py` files shall remain minimal.

They may expose:

```text
Version
Small stable public interfaces
```

They shall not import every class from every module.

Large re-export chains can create circular imports and slow startup.

---

# Chapter 1826 — File Size Guidance

Source files should normally remain below approximately:

```text
500 lines
```

This is guidance rather than an absolute rule.

A file exceeding this should be reviewed for:

* Multiple responsibilities.
* Repeated helpers.
* Separate DTOs.
* Separate interfaces and implementations.
* Extractable domain rules.

---

# Chapter 1827 — Class Responsibility Rule

Every class shall have one primary reason to change.

Examples:

```text
MessagingService changes when messaging use cases change.

MessageRepository changes when message persistence changes.

MessageEncryptionService changes when client encryption implementation changes.

ChatViewModel changes when chat presentation behaviour changes.
```

These responsibilities shall not be merged into one large class.

---

# Chapter 1828 — Function Responsibility Rule

Functions shall:

* Have one clear purpose.
* Use descriptive names.
* Avoid excessive nesting.
* Validate inputs at boundaries.
* Return typed results.

* Avoid unrelated side effects.

Long workflows should be decomposed into private helper methods or collaborating services.

---

# Chapter 1829 — Naming Rules

Use:

```text
PascalCase for classes
snake_case for functions and variables
UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for true constants
leading underscore for private implementation details
```

Names shall describe business meaning.

Avoid vague names such as:

```text
Manager
Helper
Data
Thing
Process
```

unless qualified clearly.

---

# Chapter 1830 — Async Naming and Usage

Asynchronous functions do not need an `_async` suffix in Python.

Use:

```python
async def send_message(...)
```

rather than:

```python
async def send_message_async(...)
```

unless both synchronous and asynchronous variants exist and require distinction.

---

# Chapter 1831 — Result Objects

Complex operations may return typed result objects.

Examples:

```text
SendMessageResult
UploadFinalisationResult
SynchronisationResult
CacheCleanupResult
AuditVerificationResult
```

Avoid returning unstructured tuples with many values.

---

# Chapter 1832 — DTO Conversion

Conversions shall use explicit functions or class methods.

Examples:

```text
user_to_response()
message_to_encrypted_response()
attachment_to_response()
orm_to_domain()
domain_to_orm()
```

Automatic broad serialisation of ORM objects shall be avoided.

---

# Chapter 1833 — No Duplicate Models Rule

The coding AI shall not create multiple conflicting definitions of:

```text
User
Message
Conversation
Attachment
ErrorCode
WebSocketEventType
```

Where separate representations are required, names shall clarify them:

```text
UserORM
User
UserProfileResponse
CachedUser
```

---

# Chapter 1834 — No Placeholder Implementation Rule

The generated project shall not leave core methods containing only:

```python
pass
```

or:

```python
raise NotImplementedError
```

unless the class is intentionally abstract.

Version 1.0-required paths shall have real implementations.

Deferred features shall be disabled explicitly rather than represented by broken interface controls.

---

# Chapter 1835 — No Silent Exception Rule

Code shall not contain:

```python
try:
    ...
except Exception:
    pass
```

Expected exceptions shall be handled specifically.

Unexpected exceptions shall be logged and propagated to an application boundary.

---

# Chapter 1836 — No Global Mutable State Rule

Avoid global mutable instances such as:

```text
Global database session
Global current user
Global token
Global message list
Global WebSocket connection dictionary outside manager ownership
```

Application-wide state shall be owned by a container or lifecycle-managed service.

---

# Chapter 1837 — Secret Handling Rule

No source file shall contain:

```text
Real password
Real token
Real database URL
Real private key
Real LDAP bind credential
Real certificate private key
```

Example values shall be visibly fake.

---

# Chapter 1838 — Logging Rule

Every module shall use the configured structured logger.

It shall not use random `print()` statements for production diagnostics.

Command-line scripts may print user-facing status while still using structured logs for technical events.

---

# Chapter 1839 — Type-Hint Rule

Public functions, service methods, repository methods and constructors shall have type hints.

Return types shall be explicit.

`Any` shall be limited to boundaries such as validated JSONB details.

---

# Chapter 1840 — Documentation String Rule

Public classes and non-obvious functions shall include concise docstrings.

Docstrings shall explain:

* Purpose.
* Important security behaviour.
* Exceptions where useful.
* Return meaning.

They shall not repeat obvious code line by line.

---

# Chapter 1841 — Configuration Access Rule

Services shall receive configuration objects through constructors.

They shall not repeatedly read environment variables directly.

Only the configuration loader should access raw environment variables and secret files.

---

# Chapter 1842 — Database Access Rule

Only repositories and database infrastructure shall execute SQLAlchemy queries.

Routers, ViewModels and widgets shall never access database sessions.

---

# Chapter 1843 — Network Access Rule

Only networking clients and server route or WebSocket boundaries shall perform network protocol operations.

Client ViewModels shall call services rather than `httpx` directly.

---

# Chapter 1844 — Cryptography Access Rule

Only defined client security services shall perform private-key operations and content encryption.

Server code shall validate encrypted envelope structure but shall not attempt message decryption.

---

# Chapter 1845 — File Access Rule

Server file access shall go through `FileStorage`.

Client managed-cache file access shall go through client storage services.

Views shall never manipulate physical paths directly beyond receiving user-selected destination paths.

---

# Chapter 1846 — Event Handling Rule

Durable application events shall use the outbox or documented durable mechanism.

Transient events may use direct WebSocket publication.

Event handlers shall be idempotent where duplicate delivery is possible.

---

# Chapter 1847 — Version Source Rule

The application version shall have one authoritative source.

Recommended:

```text
pyproject.toml
```

`version.py` may expose the generated or imported value.

Client, server, installer and deployment manifest shall all use the same version.

---

# Chapter 1848 — Build Output Directory

Generated files shall use:

```text
build/
dist/
```

These directories shall not contain source-controlled secrets.

Most build output shall be excluded from Git.

---

# Chapter 1849 — pyproject.toml Tool Configuration

The file shall configure:

```text
Project metadata
Python version
Dependency groups
Ruff
mypy
pytest
coverage
build backend
```

Tool configuration shall not be duplicated unnecessarily in separate files.

---

# Chapter 1850 — Minimum Python Version

The project specification targets:

```text
Python 3.13 or later compatible release
```

The code shall avoid unsupported deprecated APIs.

The exact tested version shall be documented.

---

# Chapter 1851 — Source-Code Generation Order

The coding AI shall implement in this order:

```text
1. Shared enums and DTOs

2. Configuration models

After each subsystem:

```text
Run formatting
Run type checking
Run unit tests
Run relevant integration tests
Fix failures

Domain package does not import PySide6.

Views do not import repositories.

Routers do not import ORM models directly.

Server does not import client package.

* Storage.
* Workers.
* Monitoring.
* Logging.

The client shall separate:

* Domain and display models.
* Local repositories.
* Services.
* Networking.
* Cryptography.
* Secure storage.
* Workers.
* ViewModels.
* Views.
* Reusable widgets.
* Notifications.
* Administration.

Routes and views shall remain thin.

Business rules shall remain in services and domain logic.

SQL shall remain in repositories.

Private-key cryptography shall remain in client security services.

Filesystem operations shall remain behind storage interfaces.

Every major source file shall have a clear implementation contract.

---

# End of Part 21

Part 22 will define the complete class-level implementation blueprint, including:

* Constructor dependencies.
* Public methods.
* Method input and output types.
* Important private helpers.
* Service collaboration.
* State ownership.
* Async behaviour.
* Signals and callbacks.
* Repository interfaces.
* Worker lifecycles.

* Exact responsibilities of the most important classes.

---

## Task-specific authoritative source: Part 22

# Part 22 — Class-Level Implementation Blueprint

---

# Chapter 1865 — Class Blueprint Purpose

This section defines the implementation contract for the most important BlueBubbles classes.

It specifies:

* Constructor dependencies.
* Public methods.
* Input and output types.
* State ownership.
* Important private helpers.
* Async behaviour.
* Transaction boundaries.
* Signals and callbacks.
* Error behaviour.
* Collaboration between classes.

The coding AI shall use these contracts to produce consistent implementations.

Minor internal methods may be added where required, but the responsibilities defined here shall not be moved into unrelated classes.

---

# Chapter 1866 — General Constructor Rules

Constructors shall receive dependencies explicitly.

Preferred:

```python
class MessagingService:
    def __init__(
        self,
        unit_of_work_factory: UnitOfWorkFactory,
        permission_service: PermissionService,
        audit_service: AuditService,
        event_factory: EventFactory,
        clock: Clock,
    ) -> None:
        ...
```

Avoid:

```python
class MessagingService:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.database = create_database_connection()
        self.settings = load_environment_variables()
```

Classes shall not construct infrastructure dependencies internally unless construction is their defined responsibility.

---

# Chapter 1867 — Constructor State

Constructors may:

* Store validated dependencies.
* Create small in-memory structures.
* Validate static invariants.
* Prepare locks or cancellation objects.

Constructors shall not:

* Open network connections.
* Run database queries.
* Start background tasks.
* Perform blocking file operations.
* Read user data.
* Start Qt windows.
* Run migrations.

Lifecycle methods shall perform active startup work.

---

# Chapter 1868 — Public Method Rules

Public methods shall:

* Use explicit type hints.
* Return typed values.
* Raise documented application errors.
* Avoid returning raw infrastructure exceptions.
* Preserve transactional consistency.
* Check cancellation where applicable.
* Avoid unnecessary side effects.
* Use async methods for I/O.

Methods performing network, database or filesystem I/O shall normally use:

```python
async def
```

---

# Chapter 1869 — Private Helper Rules

Private helpers may be used to:

* Decompose validation.
* Build domain objects.
* Convert DTOs.
* Calculate derived values.
* Encapsulate repeated internal steps.

Private helpers shall not hide major business transactions unexpectedly.

A method called `_validate_request()` shall not secretly commit database changes.

---

# Chapter 1870 — Service Result Objects

Complex service operations shall return result objects.

Examples:

```python
@dataclass(slots=True, frozen=True)
class SendMessageResult:
    message: Message
    acknowledgement: SendMessageResponse
    outbox_event_id: UUID
```

```python
@dataclass(slots=True, frozen=True)
class AuthenticationResult:
    user: User
    session: Session
    access_token: str
    refresh_token: str
    capabilities: ServerCapabilities
```

Result objects shall make returned values self-describing.

---

# Chapter 1871 — Cancellation Model

Long-running client operations shall support cancellation.

Suitable operations:

* File upload.
* File download.
* Search-index rebuild.
* Initial synchronisation.
* Cache maintenance.
* Diagnostic package generation.

Cancellation shall use:

* `asyncio.Event`.
* A cancellation token abstraction.
* Qt-compatible worker cancellation state.

Cancellation shall not interrupt a database commit halfway through.

---

# Chapter 1872 — CancellationToken

```python
class CancellationToken:
    """Provides cooperative cancellation for long-running operations."""

    def __init__(self) -> None:

    def is_cancelled(self) -> bool:
        return self._cancelled.is_set()

    async def raise_if_cancelled(self) -> None:
        if self._cancelled.is_set():
            raise OperationCancelledError()
```

Operations shall check the token between safe processing units.

```python
class Clock(Protocol):
    """Provides application time for testable time-dependent logic."""

    def now(self) -> datetime:
        ...
```

Implementation:

```python
class SystemClock:
    def now(self) -> datetime:
        return datetime.now(timezone.utc)

```python
class IdentifierGenerator(Protocol):
    """Generates application identifiers."""

    def new_uuid(self) -> UUID:

# Chapter 1877 — ServerContainer Stop Behaviour

`stop()` shall be safe when:

* Startup completed.
* Startup partially completed.
* Stop was already called.
* One component fails during shutdown.

It shall attempt every cleanup stage even if an earlier cleanup fails.

Shutdown errors shall be collected and logged.

    ...
```

The factory shall not cache disposable conversation-specific ViewModels indefinitely.

---

# Chapter 2006 — View Constructor Rules

A view constructor shall normally receive:

```text
ViewModel
Parent widget
Optional presentation-only dependencies
```

Example:

```python
class ChatPage(QWidget):
    def __init__(
        self,
        viewmodel: ChatViewModel,
        parent: QWidget | None = None,
    ) -> None:
        super().__init__(parent)
```

Views shall not receive database repositories or cryptographic services.

---

# Chapter 2007 — Signal Connection Rules

Views shall:

* Connect signals during setup.
* Disconnect or dispose cleanly.
* Avoid duplicate signal registration.
* Avoid anonymous lambdas when they prevent cleanup.
* Use queued connections where cross-thread delivery requires it.
* Update widgets only on the GUI thread.

---

# Chapter 2008 — Worker-to-ViewModel Communication

Workers shall emit:

```text
progress
state
completion
failure
```

ViewModels shall translate worker events into UI state.

Views shall observe ViewModels.

Preferred flow:

```text
Worker

↓

Service

↓

ViewModel

↓

View
```

Direct worker-to-widget coupling shall be avoided.

---

# Chapter 2009 — ClientEventStream Blueprint

```python
class ClientEventStream:
    """Provides local publish-subscribe communication between client services."""

    def subscribe(
        self,
        event_type: type[ClientApplicationEvent],
        handler: ClientEventHandler,

    async def publish(
        self,
        event: ClientApplicationEvent,
    ) -> None:
        ...
```

Subscriptions shall be disposable to prevent memory leaks.

---

# Chapter 2010 — ClientErrorService Blueprint

```python
class ClientErrorService:
    def __init__(
        self,
        catalogue: ErrorMessageCatalog,
        logger: BoundLogger,
    ) -> None:

    exception: BaseException,
) -> ClientError:
    ...

def log(
    self,
    error: ClientError,
    exception: BaseException | None = None,
) -> None:

        settings: CircuitBreakerSettings,
        clock: Clock,
    ) -> None:
        ...
```

Public method:

    operation: Callable[[], Awaitable[T]],
) -> T:
    ...
```

State:

```text

```

Only dependency-classified failures shall increment the circuit failure count.

---

# Chapter 2013 — RetryExecutor Blueprint

```python
class RetryExecutor:
    def __init__(
        self,
        policy_registry: RetryPolicyRegistry,
        sleep: AsyncSleep,
        secure_random: SecureRandom,

        ...
```

Public method:

```python
async def execute(
    self,
    operation: Callable[[], Awaitable[T]],
    context: RetryContext,
) -> T:
    ...
```

It shall:

* Check idempotency.
* Check cancellation.
* Classify error.
* Apply bounded delay.
* Respect server retry-after.
* Preserve final exception.

---

# Chapter 2014 — MetricsCollector Blueprint

```python
class MetricsCollector:
    def increment(
        self,
        metric: MetricName,
        value: int = 1,
        labels: Mapping[str, str] | None = None,
    ) -> None:
        ...

    def observe(
        self,
        metric: MetricName,
        value: float,
        labels: Mapping[str, str] | None = None,
    ) -> None:
        ...

    def snapshot(self) -> MetricsSnapshot:
        ...
```

Labels shall not include:

* Message IDs.
* Usernames.
* Full paths.
* Tokens.
* Plaintext values.

---

# Chapter 2015 — Service Thread-Safety

Server services may be application singletons.

Therefore, they shall not store request-specific mutable state such as:

```text
current_user
current_session
current_transaction
current_conversation
```

Such data shall be passed into each method.

Shared mutable caches shall use safe concurrency controls.

---

# Chapter 2016 — Client Thread-Safety

Client services may be called from:

* Qt GUI task context.
* Async workers.
* WebSocket receive tasks.
* Synchronisation tasks.

Mutable shared client state shall be protected through:

* Async locks.
* Serialised repositories.
* Event-loop confinement.
* Qt queued signals.
* Immutable models where practical.

SQLite access shall follow one documented concurrency strategy.

---

# Chapter 2017 — SQLite Concurrency Strategy

Recommended:

```text
One local database manager

One controlled write queue or write lock

Short-lived read operations

WAL mode where compatible

No direct access from arbitrary worker threads
```

Database calls from Qt workers shall be scheduled through the approved async storage layer.

---

# Chapter 2018 — Resource Ownership

Ownership rules:

```text
DatabaseManager owns SQLAlchemy engine.

UnitOfWork owns one database session.

ServerContainer owns managers and workers.

WebSocketConnection owns one socket.

ClientContainer owns authenticated services.

LocalDatabaseManager owns SQLite connections.

Worker owns its cancellation token.

View owns its ViewModel lifecycle where created specifically for that view.
```

Every owned resource shall have a matching cleanup path.

---

# Chapter 2019 — Context Manager Usage

Use async context managers for:

* Unit of Work.
* Database sessions.
* File streams where supported.
* Temporary directories.
* Locks where needed.
* HTTP streaming responses.

Example:

```python
async with self._unit_of_work_factory() as unit_of_work:
    ...
```

Manual cleanup shall be avoided where a context manager provides stronger guarantees.

---

# Chapter 2020 — Important Immutable Models

Prefer frozen dataclasses or immutable Pydantic models for:

```text
AuthenticatedUser
AccessTokenClaims
PublicKeyDescriptor
MessageEncryptionContext
AttachmentEncryptionContext
ServerCapabilities
RetryPolicy
```

Immutable values reduce accidental state modification.

---

# Chapter 2021 — Mutable Domain Models

Mutable domain entities may be used where behaviour changes state explicitly.

Example:

```python
class Session:
    def invalidate(
        self,
        at: datetime,
        reason: str,
    ) -> None:
        ...
```

State-changing methods shall enforce invariants.

Repositories shall persist the resulting entity state.

---

# Chapter 2022 — Domain Method Versus Service Method

Use a domain method when:

* The rule concerns one entity.
* No database query is required.
* No external service is required.

Use a service method when:

* Multiple entities participate.
* Permissions must be checked.
* Repositories are required.
* A transaction is required.
* Events or audits are created.

Example:

```text
Session.invalidate()

Domain method

SessionService.invalidate_all_for_user()

Application service
```

---

# Chapter 2023 — Mapper Blueprint

Example:

```python
class MessageMapper:
    @staticmethod
    def to_domain(
        orm: MessageORM,
    ) -> Message:
        ...

    @staticmethod
    def to_response(
        message: Message,
        recipient_key: MessageRecipientKey,
    ) -> EncryptedMessageResponse:
        ...
```

Mappers shall not:

* Query repositories.
* Perform permission checks.
* Decrypt content.
* Commit transactions.

---

# Chapter 2024 — Factory Blueprint

Factories may construct complex domain objects.

Example:

```python
class MessageFactory:
    def __init__(
        self,
        clock: Clock,
    ) -> None:
        ...

    def create_from_request(
        self,
        sender_id: UUID,
        request: SendMessageRequest,
    ) -> Message:
        ...
```

Factories shall validate object construction invariants but not external authority.

---

# Chapter 2025 — EventFactory Blueprint

```python
class EventFactory:
    def __init__(
        self,
        clock: Clock,
        identifier_generator: IdentifierGenerator,
        protocol_version: int,
    ) -> None:
        ...
```

Public methods:

```python
def message_stored(
    self,
    message: Message,
    recipients: Sequence[UUID],
) -> OutboxEvent:
    ...

def session_revoked(
    self,
    session: Session,
) -> OutboxEvent:
    ...

def group_member_removed(
    self,
    conversation_id: UUID,
    user_id: UUID,
) -> OutboxEvent:
    ...
```

Payloads shall contain no plaintext message content.

---

# Chapter 2026 — State Transition Helper

```python
class StateTransitionValidator(Generic[StateType]):
    def __init__(
        self,
        allowed_transitions: Mapping[
            StateType,
            Collection[StateType],
        ],
    ) -> None:
        ...

    def require_transition(
        self,
        current: StateType,
        target: StateType,
    ) -> None:
        ...
```

This may support:

* File transfers.
* Upload sessions.
* Offline actions.
* Security alerts.
* Export jobs.

---

# Chapter 2027 — Error Translation Boundaries

Translation shall occur at these boundaries:

```text
Infrastructure library error

↓

Repository or infrastructure adapter error

↓

Application service error

↓

API or client error model
```

Example:

```text
OSError ENOSPC

↓

StorageCapacityError

↓

SERVER_STORAGE_FULL

↓

User-facing storage message
```

---

# Chapter 2028 — Method Logging Rules

A service method may log:

* Operation started at debug level.
* Successful significant result at info level.
* Expected degraded result at warning level.
* Unexpected failure at boundary.

It shall not log:

* Plaintext message.
* Plaintext draft.
* Password.
* Secret key.
* Raw token.
* Complete encrypted payload.

---

# Chapter 2029 — Method Metrics Rules

Important methods shall record:

```text
operation count
success count
failure count
duration
retry count where applicable
```

Examples:

```text
AuthenticationService.login
MessagingService.send_message
AttachmentService.complete_upload
SynchronisationService.initial_sync
```

Metrics shall be recorded around the operation boundary rather than inside every private helper.

---

# Chapter 2030 — Method Timeout Rules

External and infrastructure operations shall have bounded timeouts.

Examples:

```text
LDAP search
Redis command
HTTP request
WebSocket authentication
Storage health check
Database statement
```

Business methods shall not wait indefinitely for dependency calls.

---

# Chapter 2031 — Class Test Contract

Every important class shall have tests covering:

```text
Successful operation
Validation failure
Permission failure where applicable
Dependency failure
Cancellation where applicable
State transition
Resource cleanup
Sensitive-data handling
```

Constructor tests shall verify required dependencies and safe initial state where useful.

---

# Chapter 2032 — Service Collaboration Tests

Tests shall verify that:

* `AuthenticationService` calls provider but not LDAP implementation details.
* `MessagingService` uses repository interfaces.
* `AttachmentService` uses `FileStorage`.
* `ChatViewModel` uses client services, not API client directly.
* `MessageWidget` does not decrypt data.
* `AdminService` uses permission service.
* `AuditWriter` shares the business Unit of Work.

---

# Chapter 2033 — Mocking Guidance

Mock:

* External provider boundaries.
* Network clients.
* Operating-system secure store.
* Clock.
* Random provider where deterministic behaviour is needed.

Prefer fakes for:

* Repositories.
* Event publisher.
* File storage.
* Local cache.

Do not mock every internal helper in a way that prevents meaningful behaviour testing.

---

# Chapter 2034 — Method Documentation Contract

Public service methods shall document:

```text
Purpose
Authorisation expectation
Important validation
Return value
Expected application errors
Transactional behaviour
```

Example:

```python
async def send_message(...) -> SendMessageResponse:
    """Store one encrypted message.

    The sender must be an active conversation member. The operation
    validates complete recipient-key coverage and commits the message,
    audit event and outbox event in one transaction.

    Raises:
        NotConversationMemberError
        InvalidRecipientKeysError
        MessageConflictError
    """
```

---

# Chapter 2035 — No Boolean Ambiguity

Avoid methods such as:

```python
update_user(user_id, True, False, True)
```

Prefer:

```python
update_user(
    user_id,
    UserUpdate(
        is_enabled=True,
        is_archived=False,
        revoke_sessions=True,
    ),
)
```

Keyword-only parameters and typed command objects shall be used for complex operations.

---

# Chapter 2036 — Command Objects

Use command objects for complex writes.

Examples:

```text
SendClientMessageCommand
CreateGroupCommand
DisableUserCommand
PrepareAttachmentCommand
PublishAnnouncementCommand
UpdateConfigurationCommand
```

Commands shall be validated before the transaction begins.

---

# Chapter 2037 — Query Objects

Use query objects for complex reads.

Examples:

```text
ConversationListQuery
MessagePageQuery
AuditQuery
UserSearchQuery
SecurityAlertQuery
```

Query objects shall contain validated filters, limits and cursors.

---

# Chapter 2038 — Optional Values

Optional values shall use:

```python
Type | None
```

The meaning of `None` shall be documented.

For updates, distinguish:

```text
Field not supplied

from

Field explicitly cleared
```

Pydantic field-set information or dedicated patch models may be used.

---

# Chapter 2039 — Collection Types

Use:

```text
Sequence
Collection
Mapping
```

in interfaces where mutation is not required.

Return concrete immutable or list types where callers need predictable behaviour.

Avoid passing mutable lists that a callee may retain and modify unexpectedly.

---

# Chapter 2040 — Byte Handling

Binary security fields shall use:

```python
bytes
```

internally.

Base64 encoding and decoding shall occur at protocol boundaries.

Do not repeatedly encode and decode inside business services.

---

# Chapter 2041 — Secret Value Types

Use wrappers such as:

```text
SecretStr
SecretBytes
PrivateKeyHandle
RefreshTokenValue
```

where practical.

Secret wrappers shall prevent accidental representation in logs.

---

# Chapter 2042 — Async Task Ownership

Every created background task shall have an owner.

Examples:

```text
WebSocketClient owns receive and heartbeat tasks.

BackgroundWorker owns its loop task.

ClientApplication owns shutdown tasks.

UploadWorker owns chunk-transfer tasks.
```

Unowned `asyncio.create_task()` calls shall be avoided.

---

# Chapter 2043 — Task Failure Handling

Owned tasks shall:

* Be awaited or monitored.
* Report exceptions.
* Support cancellation.
* Be removed from owner state after completion.
* Not disappear silently.

Task callbacks shall retrieve exceptions to avoid unobserved task warnings.

---

# Chapter 2044 — Lock Ownership

Locks shall belong to the class protecting the state.

Examples:

```text
TokenRefreshCoordinator owns refresh lock.

WebSocketConnection owns send lock.

WebSocketConnectionManager owns registry lock.

OfflineQueueService owns processing lock.

Audit chain transaction owns database row lock.
```

Global unrelated locks shall not be used.

# Chapter 2045 — Deadlock Avoidance in Classes

Rules:

* Acquire locks in documented order.
* Do not hold an in-memory lock during slow network I/O unless required.
* Avoid calling unknown external handlers while holding a lock.
* Keep database row-lock transactions short.
* Do not combine Qt thread locks and asyncio locks unnecessarily.

---

# Chapter 2046 — Class Lifecycle Interfaces

Lifecycle-managed classes may implement:

```python
class AsyncLifecycle(Protocol):
    async def start(self) -> None:
        ...

    async def stop(self) -> None:
        ...
```

Examples:

```text
DatabaseManager
RedisManager
WebSocketClient
WebSocketConnectionManager
WorkerManager
ClientContainer
ServerContainer
```

---

# Chapter 2047 — Idempotent Lifecycle Methods

`stop()` should generally be idempotent.

`start()` may:

* Return immediately if already started.
* Raise a clear lifecycle error.
* Be idempotent where safe.

The behaviour shall be documented and tested.

6. Authentication and session infrastructure

7. Permission and user services

8. Conversation and group services

9. Messaging service

10. Attachment storage and service

11. Audit and outbox services

12. WebSocket infrastructure

13. Workers and monitoring

14. Client secure store and local database

15. Client networking and session management

16. Client key and encryption services

17. Client messaging, transfer and sync services

18. ViewModels

19. Views and widgets

20. Administration client classes
```

Each stage shall be tested before the next depends upon it.

# Chapter 2052 — Class Blueprint Summary

BlueBubbles shall use explicit constructor injection and clearly owned state.

Server services shall be stateless across requests except for safe shared caches and managers.

Database work shall use short-lived Units of Work.

Business transactions shall include their audit and outbox records where required.

Authentication providers shall only authenticate identities and shall not issue application sessions.

The server MessagingService shall validate and store encrypted envelopes without decrypting them.

Client encryption services shall own content encryption, recipient key envelopes and signatures.

The client MessagingService shall coordinate local pending state, encryption, offline queueing, server submission and incoming-message processing.

Long-running operations shall support cooperative cancellation.

Workers shall expose progress and shall not manipulate widgets directly.

ViewModels shall own presentation state and call services.

Views shall render state and emit user actions.

Every async task, lock, connection and worker shall have one clear owner and cleanup path.

The coding AI shall implement these class contracts consistently and shall not merge unrelated responsibilities into monolithic classes.
